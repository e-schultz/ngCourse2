# Internationalization in Angular

Internationalization \(or _i18n_, which stands for _i--n_\) is the process of adapting software and web applications to multiple languages, allowing their application to be used by multiple language-speaking users. By ensuring that your application supports multiple languages, you can reach a broader audience and ensure a smooth user experience for multilingual users.
