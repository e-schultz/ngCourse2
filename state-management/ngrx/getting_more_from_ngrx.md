# Getting More From @ngrx

## @ngrx

@ngrx provides most of its Redux implementation through the [ngrx/store](https://github.com/ngrx/store) module. Other modules are available for better integration and development.

* [_ngrx/store-devtools_](https://github.com/ngrx/store-devtools) - an ngrx implementation of the Redux DevTools
* [_ngrx/effects_](https://github.com/ngrx/effects) - a model for performing side-effects similar to `redux-saga`
* [_ngrx/router_](https://github.com/ngrx/router) and [_ngrx/router-store_](https://github.com/ngrx/router-store) - a router for Angular that can be connected to your ngrx store
