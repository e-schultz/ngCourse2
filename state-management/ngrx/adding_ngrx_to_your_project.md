# Adding @ngrx to your Project

In your console, run the following command to add [@ngrx](https://github.com/ngrx) to your list of dependencies in `package.json`:

```text
npm install @ngrx/store --save
```

Additionally, if you are using Angular CLI (6+), you can take advantage of angular schematics and use this command:

```text
ng add @ngrx/store@latest
```
