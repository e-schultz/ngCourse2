# Typings

Since our project and unit tests are written in TypeScript, we need type definitions for the libraries we'll be writing our tests with \(Chai and Jasmine\). In [angular2-redux-example](https://github.com/rangle/angular2-redux-example) we have included these type definitions from `@types`.

If you're following the example of angular2-redux-starter and using a `tests.entry` file to specify your project testing requirements, bear in mind you'll also need to add node typings to your dependencies.
